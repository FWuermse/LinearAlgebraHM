# Linear Algebra HM

This repository is a playground for our linear algebra lectures (based on Dr. Strangs lectures at MIT).
Another reason for this project is to get more familiar with performance differences of list comprehension, zip and
lambdas in Python3.8.

Be aware that this project does not provide accurate or performant solutions for matrix operations but is meant for
testing.

## Roadmap

* Matrix addition
* Matrix multiplication
* Gauss elimination
* Gauss Jordan elimination
* Transpose matrices
* Calculation of kernels
* Special solutions
* Solvability of Matrices
* Row echelon form
* Orthogonal / Orthonormal Matrices
* Eigenvectors / Eigenvalues

## Contribute

If you find yourself bored and want to contribute to my understanding of Linear Algebra / Python basics feel free to 
look through the code and let me know when some sections can be refactored to be: easier to read, more simple, more
accurate. Especially considering python best practices.
